<h2 id="DeepStock">DeepStock</h2><p>This my master project. DeepStock is a framework that uses financial reports to predict the movement of stock prices with <strong>deep learning</strong> techniques. <strong>Information retrieval</strong> and <strong>natrual language processing</strong> techniques are used in the text processing steps. Deep learning models used include <em>Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDA), Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Recurrent Neural Networks-Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RNNRBM)</em>. The first two are the classic deep learning models and the last one has the potential ability to handle the temporal effects of sequential data. Through the analysis on experiment results, <em>the proposed models exhibit the importance of predicting stock price trend with containing textual information.</em> The comparison between the performance results of the three deep learning models with <em>SVM</em> and <em>Random Forest</em> shows that <em>deep learning models have a potential applicability in the context of stock trend prediction, especially for DBN and RNNRBM.</em></p>
<p>The dissertation was given a high distinction mark, 76 (70 is a first class mark in UK, as A+ in US), <strong>which is a top ranked dissertation among the students in MSc Computer Science at the University of Oxford</strong>. The marker said “it is a really <strong>impressive dissertation</strong>“ in the feedback. The dissertation can be accessed <a href="http://psyyz10.github.io/about/Dissertation-YaoZhang.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Music_Composer">Music Composer</h2><p>It is a extracurricular project bulit during the peroid of my postgraduate study for covering my living cost. It is a professional composition software which allows music composer to compose music with this program. The user can compose the music by selecting the a certain kind of note on a corresponding position. It can parse and then visualize the music sequence for each MidiEvent. The user can select the track and channel they want to edit. It support 128 kinds of instruments in 16 categories. The program is built with <em>Java</em> and <em>JavaFX</em>. <strong>Java MIDI</strong> library are used to process the music notes.   </p>
<h2 id="LeafDiag">LeafDiag</h2><p>This my undergraduate final year project. LeafDiag is an <em>Android</em> mobile application which can automatically identify the plants diseases based on its leaf appearance with some <strong>computer vision</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> techniques. The target group of the user is those who request a free and quick diagnosis on common leaf disease at any time of the day. EM and Otsu algorithms were used for segmentation. Color histogram and Tamura’s texture feature were extracted. <em>ANN, SVM</em> and <em>Random Forest</em> learning models were built respectively. Experiments and evaluations on different segmentations, feature extractions and classification methods were done to find the most effective approach. The higest average accuracy is <strong>96.4%</strong>. Another desktop version was also developed. The application was mainly built with <em>Java and Matlab</em>. It was rewarded as a <strong>first class project</strong>. The source code can be access <a href="https://github.com/psyyz10/LeafDiag" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. The report can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/psyyz10/LeafDiag/blob/master/project.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="HMTC_Compiler">HMTC Compiler</h2><p>HMTC is a compiler course project. We are required to design, implement and extend a complete complier for a small language, <em>MiniTriangle</em>, using functional programming language, <strong>Haskell</strong> with <strong>Monad</strong>. We extended MiniTriangle with various new constructs and then extended the compiler accordingly. The compiler is called HMTC (for Haskell MiniTriangle Compiler). The compiler is a complete compiler including type checking and code generation. The source code can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/psyyz10/compiler-haskell" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. The reports can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/psyyz10/compiler-haskell/blob/master/yxz02u-report-partI.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">here (Part-I)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/psyyz10/compiler-haskell/blob/master/yxz02u-report-partII.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">here (Part-II)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Castle">Castle</h2><p>It is a small project in Graphics course. The program shows a 3D view of a Castle, robotics, threes, lights and so on. It was built with <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>OpenGL</strong>. It is a practical of computer graphics including camera viewing, projection, lighting models, texture Mapping. The code can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/psyyz10/Castle" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="BidApp">BidApp</h2><p>BidApp is a group project. I play a role of <strong>technical lead</strong> and <strong>main programmer</strong>. BidApp is a system providing users with a website, accessible via web browsers on mobile devices, which aimed to improve the process of online auctioning. The user can set and bid an auction in this platform. The fucntions are shown in the following flow-chart. The project was developed with <strong>J2EE, JS, CSS, JQuery</strong>. Some advanced alogrithms are designed and implemented such as proxy bidding, item recommendation, and P2P Network Reputation Management. The project and report was given a <strong>first-class</strong> mark 74, and I got a <strong>highest individual mark 84</strong> (70 is a first class mark in UK, as A+ in US). The source code can be accessed from <a href="https://github.com/psyyz10/BidApp" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a> and the report can be accessed from <a href="https://github.com/psyyz10/BidApp/blob/master/documents/G52GRPFinalGroupReportGP12-MVR2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Battle_City_Tank_War_Game">Battle City Tank War Game</h2><p>This is a C++ programming course project. We required to implement a game with different levels of intelligence. With hard work through most Easter holiday, the game ‘Battle City’ was finished, which is a modificated version of my favorite video game in my childhood. User can choose servral levels with different map. There are many game props in the game, such as time frozen, short invincible state, bomb and so on. The enemy tank has different four levels of intelligence. They can search the shortest path to the player. They have different lookings, speed, health and base damage. The game was developed with <strong>C++</strong> by hand without using any other game library. The marker said that it is a successfully reproduce of the classic tank war game. It was given a top ranked mark 82. And the game was requested shown in <strong>the Hall of Fame as an excellent example</strong>. The source code can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/psyyz10/battle-city" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. </p>
